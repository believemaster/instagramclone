## Why this is made ?
This was just made for my learning purposes as I was in my 5th semester in my B.Tech(Computer Science and Engineering), I was having a subject called web development and there includes many language for making website and web-apps. And one of them is Ruby-Rails as a server side so while attending my lectures I learned this language by making this instagram clone so that i can learn something new. Also Git is made on ruby so, i was keen to know what it takes to build useing ruby rails.

## What Other Technologies Used:
I've used cloudinary for online image saving and uploading the images. HTML, SCSS is used for frontend view.I also want to include the 
Ruby's Devise that is on Git to make registration form. 

### What was purpose ?
There is nothing important for me more than gaining more knowlede and learning new technologies so that i can update myself and other people with what is present in today's scenario. Moreover so that I can guide anyone what to learn and which thing suits them.
